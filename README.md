# Dress Me Up (AT&T Mobile Hachathon Winner)
This web app leverages the Macy's APIs so when a user purchases a piece of clothing, the app suggests other pieces of clothing to complement the outfit based on color, style, brand, etc.

# User Case

If a user buys a blue pair of slim jeans, and then starts searching for shirts, the app makes suggestions for  shirts that go with that type of jeans: a color that is a good contrast to blue, made of a material that fits well with jeans, etc.
